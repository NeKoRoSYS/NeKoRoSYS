# Hi, I am NeKoRoSYS!
I am an aspiring software developer, and my goal is to learn a lot of aspects that come in developing software such as video games and even tools. I am currently working alone but I am happy to work with anyone if I pass the criteria.

I am currently learning C# for Unity game development, however, I am also trying to do some web development using intermediate HTML, CSS, and JS.

You can find more about me on my [website](https://nekorosys.github.io)'s About Me tab!
