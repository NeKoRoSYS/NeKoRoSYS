# Hi, I am NeKoRoSYS!
I am a 17-year-old Filipino who is currently studying in senior high school. I am an aspiring software and game developer, and my goal is to learn a lot of aspects that come in developing projects such as video games, or even outside game development. I am currently working alone but I am happy to work with anyone if I pass the criteria.

I am currently learning C# for Unity game development, but I am also trying to do some web development using intermediate HTML and CSS.

You can find more about me at my [website](https://nekorosys.github.io)'s About Me tab!
