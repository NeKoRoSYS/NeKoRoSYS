# Hi, I am NecroMarX!
I am Filipino, and is currently 16 years old. I am an aspiring software and game developer! My goal is to learn a lot of aspects that come in developing projects such as video games, or even stuff outside game development. I am currently working alone but I am happy to work with anyone if I pass the criteria.
