# Hi, I am NeKoRoSYS!
I am a 16-year-old Filipino and is currently studying in high school. I am an aspiring software and game developer, my goal is to learn a lot of aspects that come in developing projects such as video games, or even stuff outside game development. I am currently working alone but I am happy to work with anyone if I pass the criteria.

You can find more about me at my [website](https://nekorosys.github.io)'s About Me tab!
